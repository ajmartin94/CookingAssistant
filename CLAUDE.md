## 🎯 Project Overview

**Cooking Assistant** is an AI-powered cooking companion designed to help users plan, shop, and cook with ease. The project emphasizes:

- **Local-first development** → easy to run, privacy-focused
- **AI-everywhere approach** → manual, AI-assist, and full automation modes
- **Progressive enhancement** → start simple, scale when needed
- **LLM-friendly data structures** → JSON/SQLite for easy AI integration

### Key Features (Planned)
- Recipe management with AI suggestions
- Meal planning and smart grocery lists
- Interactive step-by-step cooking mode
- Voice-assisted guidance
- Calendar and smart home integrations

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Initial Setup

1. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Database Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   alembic upgrade head  # Run migrations
   ```

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make changes following subdirectory-specific standards**

3. **Test your changes:**
   ```bash
   cd backend && pytest          # Backend tests
   cd frontend && npm test       # Frontend tests
   ```

4. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(scope): brief description"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## 🔀 Git Conventions

### Branch Naming
- `main` - production-ready code
- `develop` - integration branch for features
- `feature/description` - new features
- `fix/description` - bug fixes
- `docs/description` - documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - code refactoring
- `test/description` - test additions/updates

### Commit Messages

Follow the Conventional Commits specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(recipes): add recipe import from URL functionality
fix(planning): correct grocery list deduplication logic
docs: update API documentation for cooking endpoints
refactor(ai): simplify prompt construction for recipe generation
test(auth): add comprehensive authentication service tests
```

## 🤖 AI Integration Principles

### General Guidelines

1. **LLM-Friendly Data Structures:**
   - Store recipes, instructions, and metadata in structured JSON
   - Use clear, descriptive field names
   - Include context in prompts (user preferences, dietary restrictions)

2. **Three Modes of Operation:**
   - **Manual Mode:** User has full control, no AI suggestions
   - **AI Assist:** AI provides suggestions, user approves
   - **AI Automation:** End-to-end workflows with minimal user input

3. **Prompt Engineering:**
   - Use system prompts to define AI behavior
   - Include examples (few-shot learning)
   - Validate AI outputs before saving
   - Handle errors gracefully

## 🚨 Important Principles for AI Assistants

### Do's ✅

- **Read existing code before modifying** - Understand patterns and conventions
- **Use type hints** - Python and TypeScript both benefit from types
- **Write tests** - Especially for business logic and AI features
- **Keep it simple** - Start with the simplest solution that works
- **Document complex logic** - Especially AI prompts and business rules
- **Follow the three-mode principle** - Manual, AI-assist, AI-automation
- **Validate AI outputs** - Never trust LLM responses blindly
- **Check subdirectory CLAUDE.md files** - They contain specific guidance for each area

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't over-engineer** - Build what's needed now, not what might be needed
- **Don't skip error handling** - Especially for AI features and external APIs
- **Don't hardcode values** - Use configuration files
- **Don't ignore security** - Validate inputs, sanitize outputs, use proper auth
- **Don't commit secrets** - Use environment variables
- **Don't break existing tests** - Fix or update them appropriately
- **Don't mix concerns** - Keep business logic separate from API routes
- **Don't skip reading subdirectory guides** - Context-specific advice is there for a reason

### Security Considerations

- **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **SQL Injection:** Use ORM parameterized queries
- **XSS Prevention:** Sanitize data before rendering in frontend
- **Authentication:** Implement proper user authentication (JWT recommended)
- **Authorization:** Check user permissions before allowing actions
- **Rate Limiting:** Protect API endpoints from abuse
- **Secrets Management:** Never commit API keys or passwords
- **CORS:** Configure properly for frontend-backend communication

- **Dependency Injection** - FastAPI's built-in DI for database sessions
- **Component Composition** - React component design
- **Hooks Pattern** - React custom hooks for reusable logic

## 🔄 Document Maintenance

The CLAUDE.md files in each subdirectory should be updated when:
- New conventions are established in that area
- Tech stack changes for that component
- New patterns are adopted
- Significant refactoring occurs

**Last reviewed:** 2026-01-03
**Next review recommended:** After Phase 2 completion
