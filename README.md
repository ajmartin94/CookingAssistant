## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Current (local-first)
- **Backend:** [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (Python) – simple, fast, API-first  
- **Frontend:** [React](https://react.dev/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (web)  
- **Database:** SQLite (easy migration later to Postgres)  
- **AI Integration:** [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) (local) or OpenAI API  
- **Vector Search (Future):** Chroma / Weaviate (for semantic recipe search)  

### Future (upgrade path)
- **Frontend (Mobile):**  
  - Start as a **web app (React)**  
  - Add **PWA support** for installable mobile experience  
  - Later: wrap with **Capacitor** or migrate UI to **React Native**  
- **Backend (Cloud-ready):** Migrate SQLite → PostgreSQL (Supabase, Railway, Render)  
- **AI Models:** Hybrid (local models for privacy, API for advanced reasoning)

## 🧑‍💻 Development Setup

### ✅ Project Initialization Complete!

The Project Initialization Phase has been implemented. Both backend and frontend are ready to run.

### Backend Setup (FastAPI + SQLite)

1. **Navigate to backend directory**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env if needed (optional for development)
   ```

5. **Run the server**
   ```bash
   python -m app.main
   ```

   - Health Check: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health

### Frontend Setup (React + Vite)

1. **Navigate to frontend directory**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env if needed (optional for development)
   ```

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This project uses [beads](https://github.com/anthropics/beads) for roadmap and issue tracking:

```bash
bd ready              # Show issues ready to work on
bd list --status=all  # List all issues (open, closed, etc.)
bd stats              # Project statistics
```
