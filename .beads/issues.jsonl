This blocks all smoke tests which gate other E2E tests.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Smoke test 'login flow works end-to-end' fails with 500 on registration\n- Direct curl/Python calls to same endpoint succeed\n- Backend logs show tables created correctly\n- bcrypt works in venv Python\n\nPossible causes to investigate:\n1. Playwright webserver environment variables not passed correctly\n2. Database file permissions or locking\n3. Playwright request context sending different content-type/encoding\n4. Race condition in table creation vs first request","notes":"## Investigation Findings\n\n### Root Cause Identified\nThe issue is **port conflicts with existing servers**. Playwright config has reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI which means locally it reuses existing servers instead of starting fresh ones.\n\n### Key Discoveries\n\n1. **WebServer is already available** - Playwright detects an existing server on port 8000/5173 and reuses it instead of starting the E2E-configured one\n\n2. **The existing server lacks E2E_TESTING=true** - So it uses a different database (production vs test) and doesnt drop/recreate tables\n\n3. **Direct tests work fine** - When running httpx directly in Python, registration returns 201. The backend code itself is correct.\n\n4. **DEBUG env var conflict** - Using DEBUG=pw:webserver causes a Pydantic validation error because the backend config has a debug boolean field\n\n### Steps to Reproduce Clean Test Run\n1. Kill all servers (python, node)\n2. Remove test database: rm -f backend/cooking_assistant_test_e2e.db\n3. Run with CI=true: CI=true npx playwright test --project=chromium\n\n### Potential Fixes\n1. Change Playwright config to always start fresh servers (reuseExistingServer: false)\n2. Use different ports for E2E testing (e.g., 8001, 5174)\n3. Add a check in global-setup to verify E2E_TESTING is set on the backend\n4. Document that devs must stop local servers before running E2E tests\n\n### Files Modified (uncommitted)\n- backend/app/main.py - Added global exception handler for debugging\n- e2e/tests/smoke/app-health.spec.ts - Added error logging (should revert)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"martin.andrew.94@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-18T19:43:09.4749291-05:00","created_by":"ajmartin94","updated_at":"2026-01-18T20:14:52.3569724-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-18T20:14:52.3569724-05:00","close_reason":"Fixed by using different ports (8001, 5174) for E2E tests to avoid conflicts with dev servers.
