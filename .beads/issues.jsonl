Currently 5 tests pass (create/delete functionality), but 4 tests are skipped for unimplemented endpoints. This is feature-dependent and not blocking current functionality.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"martin.andrew.94@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-13T21:41:05.7906094-05:00","created_by":"ajmartin94","updated_at":"2026-01-13T21:41:05.7906094-05:00"}

Tests affected: login success, register success, logout flow, and load user from stored token. The underlying API functions work correctly, but test assertions fail due to timing. Low production impact but should be investigated for test suite completeness.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"martin.andrew.94@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-13T21:41:04.6783091-05:00","created_by":"ajmartin94","updated_at":"2026-01-13T21:41:04.6783091-05:00"}
